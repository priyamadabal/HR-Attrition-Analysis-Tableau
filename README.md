# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Tableau
Data analysis and visualisation of HR attrition factors using Tableau.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Human Resources (HR) attrition data to provide actionable insights for employee retention at the fictional ABC Organization.

The goal was to transform raw employee data into a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that allows the HR department to easily identify key drivers of attrition and make data-driven decisions to sustain the workforce.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard was built according to the provided requirements, offering the following specific visualizations and metrics:

* **Key Metrics Table:** Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Average Age.
* **Demographic Analysis:** Attrition by Gender (Lollipop Chart), Attrition Rate by Gender across Age Groups (Donut Chart).
* **Departmental & Role Analysis:** Pie Chart for Department-wise Attrition and a Highlight Table for Job Satisfaction by Job Role.
* **Driving Factors:** Histogram for Employee Count by Age Group (using a dynamic bin size parameter) and a Bar Chart for Attrition based on Education Field.

## Technologies and Tools

| Category | Tool/Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | `HR Data.csv` | Raw employee dataset. |
| **Visualization** | **Tableau Desktop** | Used to create the interactive and linked dashboard (`.twbx` file). |

## 🌟 Key Insights & Impact (Must be customized!)

* **[INSIGHT 1 - Focus on Department/Role]:** *Example: The 'Research & Development' department had the highest number of employees, but the 'Sales' department showed the highest proportional attrition rate.*
* **[INSIGHT 2 - Focus on Age/Demographic]:** *Example: Employees between the ages of 25 and 34 were the most frequent to leave, indicating a need to investigate job satisfaction or career path clarity for early-career staff.*
* **[INSIGHT 3 - Focus on Satisfaction/Work-Life]:** *Example: Job Roles with a Job Satisfaction Rating of 1 (Low) consistently showed the highest attrition rates, confirming job dissatisfaction as a major risk factor.*
